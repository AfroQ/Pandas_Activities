Using pandas to clean and sort data

## Overview

 Analysis of school and student data.



Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district: 

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school

At least one of the datasets needs to be cleaned before any analysis can be performed. She would like you to use Pandas to do a more thorough inspection of the datasets than you did when you opened them with Excel. Cleaning the data is essential because any missing, malformed, or incorrect data in the rows can jeopardize the analysis.
